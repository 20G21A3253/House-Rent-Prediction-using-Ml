            <p>Mumbai, previously known as Bombay is one of the most populous and biggest cities of Maharashtra. Also
                the biggest metropolis of this state, Mumbai is also popular as the entertainment and financial capital.
                It is the largest city of India and fondly called as the city of dreams. It is a place filled with
                dreamers and people who work hard day and night to achieve their dreams. From struggling actors,
                laboureres, Bollywood stars to gangsters, Mumbai has a lot. A lot that can be written about and talked
                about! Mumbai is also home to one of the biggest slum area as well as home to the richest and thus it is
                only fair to describe Mumbai as a city for all. The majorly spoken language is definitely Hindi and
                Marathi, but
                this city has welcomed people from all faiths and religion warmly. If you want to know and experience
                diversity, visit Mumbai. Known to
                be a city filled with warm and friendly people, we believe that anything written about Mumbai is never
                enough.

            Delhi National Capital Region or NCR includes New Delhi and the urban areas surrounding it in neighboring
            states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Delhi NCR is Indiaâ€™s largest agglomeration (or town area)
            and one of the world's largest with a population of over 47,000,000 according to the 2011 Census. It
            contributes 7.5 per cent to India's GDP.
            A seat of power for centuries, Delhi has seen numerous upheavals and has been destroyed and rebuilt on
            numerous occasions. Like every major Indian city, Delhi too straddles two worlds: the old constantly
            attempting to come to terms with the new. Old Delhi, once the capital of Mughal India, is a labyrinth of
            narrow lanes lined with crumbling havelis and formidable mosques. In contrast, the imperial city of New
            Delhi build by the British comprises spacious, tree-lined avenues and imposing government buildings.
            The city's importance lies not just in its past glory as the seat of empires and magnificent monuments, but
            also in the rich and diverse cultures. In Delhi, you will discover that the city is sprinkled with dazzling
            gems: captivating ancient monuments dot every other corner, fascinating museums and art galleries contribute
            to a thriving cultural scene and fabulous eateries and bustling markets round off a wholesome tourist
            experience.
